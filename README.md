# Miniblog.Core.Azure
Code example on how to use Mad Kristensen's Miniblog in combination with Azure Blob Storage

You can find the original repo at https://github.com/madskristensen/Miniblog.Core and https://github.com/tluijken/Miniblog.Core.azureBlobStorage 

This is an extention to enable this with Storage API V12, showing how to use this nice little blog project with Azure Blob Storage. Also some minor bugs (image being stored twice on update, image being stored as binary in XML etc) will also be fixed.
